A teenage boy goes to a co-ed boarding school away from home. At this school everyone is split into pairs, boys are paired with boys and girls are paired with girls. The philosophy is that this will better prepare them for the real world. At the school, the boy falls in love with another girl. [Fill in usual woo-ing type scenarios.]

This sort of dating is strictly prohibited at this school. Things go well on the down low. But the girl's partner and the boy's partner start to suspect them dating and gets jealous. [Fill in with typical spiraling downhill drama.]

The couple loses faith in their love of each other. Graduation is fast coming and everything blows up with the two getting caught. The boy and girl are forced to be apart at the school and relegated to different classes, dorms, etc. Parents and family are notified and tells them to end the relationship. They still want to be together dearly but don't know how to fight the system. Come graduation day, it's apparent the two gave up on their love and both decides to not go against the grain of society. [Fill in with dramatics to make the audience super sad that their love is stifled.]

At the end of the graduation, the guest speaker makes his speech. In this speech, the audience realizes why the school made such a big deal of the couple's love for each other:

In his society, only homosexual relationships are allowed. Heterosexual relationships are outlawed.
